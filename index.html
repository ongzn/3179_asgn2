                <h1>Smoking Mortality Rate: Global Perspectives</h1>
                <p class="title">
                    Smoking continues to claim millions of lives each year, making it one of the leading causes of preventable deaths globally. <br> 
                    Despite increased awareness and tobacco control measures, smoking remains deeply ingrained in many societies. <br> 
                    Regions like Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of Africa continue to see high smoking mortality rates, likely due to less effective regulations and public health campaigns. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue is not just a statistic—it’s a reminder of the ongoing battle to reduce smoking’s deadly toll. <br> 
                    Stronger interventions and more widespread awareness are critical to saving lives and reducing the long-term health impacts of smoking worldwide. <br> 
                    The fight against tobacco is far from over, and the need for action has never been more urgent.

                <p>
                  The chart highlights a concerning trend — even as some regions make progress, 
                  <br> the global death toll from smoking continues to rise, 
                  <br> 
                  reminding us of the urgent need for stronger public health interventions to tackle this issue. 
                  <br> 
                  With millions of lives lost each year,
                  <br> it’s clear that smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable deaths, 
                  <br> showing no signs of slowing down.

                    Nearly half the population still smokes, despite efforts to reduce it.

                <p>
                    Smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable deaths globally.
                    <br> 
                    This map illustrates the impact of smoking on populations worldwide,

                    <br>
                    Countries shaded in deeper red tones indicate higher mortality rates per 10,000 people <br> due to smoking-related illnesses, <br> 
                    emphasizing the severity of the issue in those areas.

            <h2>The Health Consequences of Smoking</h2>
            <p>
                Smoking poses significant risks to health, often with serious, long-term consequences. 
                <br> 
                Among its most dangerous effects are its contributions to heart disease and high cholesterol, 
                <br> two conditions that can lead to life-threatening events like heart attacks and strokes. 
                <br>
                In many parts of the world, smoking is not just a habit but a deeply ingrained cultural practice,
                <br>making it difficult to combat. 
                <br>
                <br>
                An interesting fact about these two visualizations is how they clearly illustrate 
                <br>the gender differences in health outcomes related to smoking. 
                <br>In both the “Number of Heart Attacks” and the “Number of Cholesterol > 240” charts, 
                <br>male smokers appear to be more adversely affected compared to female smokers.
