                <h1>Unveiling the Hidden Risks of Smoking: Health Impacts and Trends</h1>
                <p class="title">
                    Smoking continues to claim millions of lives each year, making it one of the leading causes of preventable deaths globally.
                    Despite increased awareness and tobacco control measures, smoking remains deeply ingrained in many societies.
                    Regions like Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of Africa continue to see high smoking mortality rates, likely due to less effective regulations and public health campaigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue is not just a statistic—it’s a reminder of the ongoing battle to reduce smoking’s deadly toll.
                    Stronger interventions and more widespread awareness are critical to saving lives and reducing the long-term health impacts of smoking worldwide.
                    The fight against tobacco is far from over, and the need for action has never been more urgent.

                    In every country and year, smoking continues to be a widespread issue. 
                    Nearly half the population still smokes, despite efforts to reduce it. 
                    The habit affects both men and women, showing how deeply rooted smoking remains in society.

                <p>
                    Smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable deaths globally.
                    Smoking mortality rates vary across different regions, 
                    with countries shaded in deeper red tones indicating higher mortality rates per 10,000 people 
                    due to smoking-related illnesses, 
                    emphasizing the severity of the issue in those areas.

            <h2>The Health Consequences of Smoking</h2>
            <p>
                Smoking poses significant risks to health, often with serious, long-term consequences. 
                Among its most dangerous effects are its contributions to heart disease and high cholesterol, 
                two conditions that can lead to life-threatening events like heart attacks and strokes. 
                In many parts of the world, smoking is not just a habit but a deeply ingrained cultural practice,
                making it difficult to combat. 
                <br>
                <br>
                An interesting fact about these two visualizations is how they clearly illustrate 
                the gender differences in health outcomes related to smoking. 
                In both the “Number of Heart Attacks” and the “Number of Cholesterol > 240” charts, 
                male smokers appear to be more adversely affected compared to female smokers.
